              I have recently found myself interested in both front end and back end development and thus have completed the html, css, javascript and jquery tracks on codecademy (more in progress) and learned to use the foundation framework. As has been suggested by many of my friends who do this professionally I will be turning my attention to angularjs bootstrapjs and nodejs shortly. But I feel that as a beginner this is a pretty nice place to start.

              I recently became accepted at a member of one of my local hacker space's <a href="http://familab.org/blog/">FamiLab</a> And during my two month probationary period I worked setting up one of their smaller CNC machines to cut out printed circuit boards using pcb-gcode for eaglecad and a VERY handy utility I found called autoleveller. If you would like more information go check out my posts on the <a href="http://forums.familab.org/index.php/topic,1294.0.html">familab forums</a> My user name is knkp.
